# uber-eats-gen
Is this really ethical? I'm sincerely sorry if it isn't (just a little passion project)

The main aim of this is to semi-automate the process of making an uber eats account (you still need to manually input a code because I haven't figured out imap LOL)

You will need Python 3.12+, selenium, and selenium stealth to run this.
